\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{results}

% No attack was able to leak, but number of false positive increased. 

In all experiments and evaluations we used 3-fold cross validation with case separation at
the patient level and each fold contained a balanced number
of attacks, and safe programs.

Since
our dataset was too small for effective training, we incorporated classic augmentation for the training process. We employed the DCGAN architecture to train each  class separately, using the same 3-fold cross validation process and the
same data partition.
